Tools for machine learning with audio data, including:

* audio activity detection (see [this notebook](/notebooks/feature_extraction_and_activity_detection_example.ipynb)
* feature extraction: audio chunks or mel-spectrogram
* dataset management (train/test split, create subsets...)
* (de)serializing data

An example of a typical data pipeline, from the audio file to the batch of data to be fed to the model, is given [here](/notebooks/data_pipeline_example.ipynb?viewer=nbviewer).
